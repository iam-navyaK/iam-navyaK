# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

## About Me  
Hello! I'm Koya Navya Keerthana, a passionate MERN stack developer from an ECE background who's now building cool full-stack web apps and Chrome extensions. 

I love learning by building and believe in trial, error & laughter along the way. 😄

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into MERN and building projects.  
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on MERN projects and browser extension ideas!  
💬 Ask me about the MERN stack, Chrome Extensions, or how to switch from ECE to tech.  
📫 Reach me at: keerthanakoya10@gmail.com  
⚡ Fun fact: I once added a semicolon that broke everything... and fixed it by deleting half the project. Legendary dev moment! 😅
